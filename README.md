# CHAMP_Battlebox
This is the Raspberry Pi 4, and Arduino interface for our battlebox.

Make sure to configure the touch screen so it attaches to the first monitor.
this is done inside /etc/profile.d
using with a script named assign-touch-screen.sh
if you want to modify which monitor the touch screen is plugged into this is the script to do it.
In the future it would be nice to modify this so that we determine the correct monitor from other commands.
