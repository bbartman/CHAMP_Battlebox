Arena TODOS:
Soccer Screen:
	1. Lights for game paused.
		- Switch to breathing yellow lights or blinking yellow lights?

WaitingForPlayerAndDoors Screen:
	1. Lights for waiting for players to close doors.
		- Create a special fill pattern based off of the pattern that is given through
			the configuration file. This will allow for faster communication.

	2. Lights for waiting for players to press ready.

	3. Lights for doors not closed when player presses ready.

	4. Doors - lights Make sure to change lights when if the door needs to be closed before
		   the match can begin and they are not closed.

	5. Fix the text for when a player closes a door.
		- This needs to say door closed and have the text color changed to black instead of white.
General:
	Make sure that names entered are transfered to the victory screens correctly.
		- Just need to verify this, it should already be working (I think).

Media Requirements inside of Main apps:
	1. A configuration for using unix domain sockets for communicating between main and media
		apps.
	2. Figure out how to handle communication messages.
	3. May need to switch to AsyncIO event loop for both apps.

Options/nice to haves:
	1. (Optional) Create a special button on main screen to allow people to open/close the doors?
	2. (Optional) Lights for idle.
		A. Turning off lights for idle.


Media Screens:
	Idle screen:
		Spinning coin image.

	Configuring deathmatch screen:
		- Something goes woosh onto the screen that says deathmatch?
		- Silver Death match letters with wires and things on them.
			- Maybe add plastic bits, and scuff marks.
		Sound - "Deathmatch"

	Configure Soccer Screen:
		- Image with soccer ball and broken circuits?
		Sound - "Blood sports ball"

  Waiting for players and doors screen:
		- Have something indicating that doors need to close.
		- Have something indicating door status.


	Count down screen:
		- Need to do coordinated display etc... This MIGHt be best handled
			by the fact that communication is fast on domain sockets.

	Victory Screen:
		Need to display winner name and possibly some confetti or something?
	
	Deathmatch - Match over and no winner selected yet:
		- Something that would work for both soccer and death match?
