Things to do:
1. Figure out the libraries that I'll need in order to operatate the pi side of things.
	a. Neopixel lights library https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_NeoPixel
	b. gpio zero - documentation https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
		- Library https://github.com/gpiozero/gpiozero

2. Environment stuff
	- Figure out how to launch kivy in full screen.
	- Figure out if we can use a config file for some of the default values within the project
	- Figure out how to run 2 kivy apps at the same time in full screen on two different
		screens at the same time.
	- Check into the automatic keyboard popup for kivy text input windows.

3. Make the death match stuff work the way it's supposed to.
4. try and get things working on the pi.
