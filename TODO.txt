Things to do:

1. Add input verification to match config menus.
2. Create match execution widget (or possibly not a widget)
5. Figure out the libraries that I'll need in order to operatate the pi side of things.
	a. Neopixel lights library https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_NeoPixel
	b. gpio zero - documentation https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
		- Library https://github.com/gpiozero/gpiozero

6. Environment stuff
	- Figure out how to launch kivy in full screen.
	- Figure out if we can use a config file for some of the default values within the project
	- Figure out how to run 2 kivy apps at the same time in full screen on two different
		screens at the same time.
	- Check into the automatic keyboard popup for kivy text input windows.

7. Clean up unused data module events
8. Make sure timer cancellation works for death match the same as it does for soccer.
9. Implement death match timer
10. Make timer blink when paused.
